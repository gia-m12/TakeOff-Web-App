# TakeOff
Take Off is a web application project inspired by FlightRadar24. Users are able to view, search, bookmark, and track flights. Users will be able to filter the flights by location, duration, and distance. Users could sign up and/or login to save their account information and their history of tracked flights. Users could also zoom in and out of the map. HTML, CSS, and Javascript will be used for the frontend development. Python and Oracle SQL will be used for the backend. APIs such as Geolocation will be utilized to get oneâ€™s current location and AirLabs to find airport and flight information.
